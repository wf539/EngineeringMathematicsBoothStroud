##Installation and subsequent running of Engineering Mathematics

Engineering Mathematics has an autoinstall device.  This means that on inserting the CD-ROM into your computer, the program Engineering Mathematics will automatically commence its installation procedure.  Engineering Mathematics is installed onto your computer during this procedure.  Once Engineering Mathematics is installed you do not need to use the CD-ROM again.  Run Engineering Mathematics using your Program Manager (click Start, Programs and the directory into which you installed the program).

##WARNING!
If you re-install the program you will lose your answers to any partially completed questions, and you will delete all question status symbols from your previous visit(s).

The initial installation of the program takes up about 12MB on your hard drive. Downloading the Further Problems will require additional space but in the current version of the program this should not exceed 20 MB for the entire program.

Clearing Engineering Mathematics of user material from previous visits

To do this you need to re-install the CD-ROM.

##Licence Agreement

Completing the installation procedure confirms your acceptance of the terms laid out in the Palgrave CD-ROM Licence Agreement. A copy of the Agreement is in file LICENSE

##Accessing the Further Problems

The Further Problems are not stored on the CD-ROM.  You can download them into your program a section at a time by double-clicking on any of the Further Problem entries in the Explorer menu within Engineering Mathematics.  The download is automatic and should only take a few minutes depending on the speed of your internet connection.  Once downloaded this section will be permanently available to you.  You will need to register online by completing a short questionnaire before you can start your first download.  You will only need to register once.  Subsequent downloads of other sections will not require a further registration.

Palgrave will store small upgrades and/or fixes for Engineering Mathematics Personal Tutor on its server.  When you access the Further Problems, such material will be automatically downloaded to you.

##Removing the Engineering Mathematics Personal Tutor from your computer.

Apart from the icons in the Start Menu, Engineering Mathematics only installs files into the directory you specify during the installation process.  You can remove the program by deleting all the files and folders in that directory.  Remove the entries from the Start Menu by right-clicking on Start and opening the folder in which you placed the icons during installation. Delete icons and folders as appropriate.
